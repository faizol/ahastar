\section{Problems}
This section contains unresolved issues that we need to figure out.
It will need to be deleted at some point.
\subsection{Search effort could be more than A*}
On an empty map, hierarchical paths could involve every cluster. 
Using an A* with unlucky tie-breaking we expand every node in every cluster and do this process for each hierarchical path during refinement. 
This could expand more nodes than A*.
\par
One suggestion is to keep a shared closed list during the refinement process. 
However, Daniel believes this will not be preserve optimality (ie. a node closed during the hierarchical refinement of one path could be on the optimal path for another yet-to-be-refined hierarchial path)
