\section{Introduction}
\label{ia-sec:introduction}
Most path planning studies have been focused in one of two directions: identifying better heuristics to guide search and reducing the search space through hierarchical decomposition.
In the case of the former, it has been shown (by Malte \& Roger in AAAI-08) that even almost perfect heuristics can result in poor performance. 
In the case of the latter, the search space is reduced but optimality is not preserved. 
It seems then that the reduction of search spaces while preserving optimality, as we do in this work, is a good direction for research.

It would be good to have a simple example where A* (with unlucky tie breaking) visits all locations on the map even if the heuristic is perfect or almost perfect. 
An empty map with the start and target placed on two diagonal corners will do. Basically, we want to show here that a good heuristic is not everything we need for a fast A* search.
