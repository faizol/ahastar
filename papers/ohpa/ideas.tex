\section{Ideas}
This section contains things that have been discussed but not which are still unclear. 
It will need to be deleted at some point.

\subsection{Greedy refinement via string pulling}
Something goes here.

\subsection{Better heuristics}
We can use intervals to compute better heuristics to guide a low-level search.
$h(n) = g(nextentrance, goal) + manhattan(n, nextentrance)$
