\section{Experimental Setup}
To evaluate the effectiveness of our symmetry elimination technique we performed
a comparative analysis using A* on a number of benchmarks taken from the
the University of Alberta's freely available pathfinding library 
Hierarchical Open Graph (HOG)\footnote{\url{www.googlecode.com/projects/hog2}}:
\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Adaptive Depth} is a set of 12 maps of size 100$\times$100 in which approximately
$\frac{1}{3}$ of each map is divided into adjacent rectangular rooms of
varying size and the rest of the map is a large open area interspersed with 
large randomly placed obstacles.}
\item{\textbf{Baldur's Gate} is a set of 120 maps taken from BioWare's popular
roleplaying game \emph{Baldurs Gate II: Shadows of Amn}. 
Often appearing as a standard benchmark in the literature 
\cite{botea04,bjornsson05,bjornsson06,sturtevant05,harabor08} these maps range in 
size from 50$\times$50 to 320$\times$320 and have a distinctive 45-degree orientation.
Figure \ref{fig-bgmap} shows a typical example.}
\item{\textbf{Rooms} is a set of 300 maps of size 256$\times$256 which are divided into 32$\times$32
rectangular areas that are connected by randomly placed entrances.}
\end{itemize}

For each map we restricted movement to the four cardinal directions and generated 100 experiments by 
randomly creating valid problems between arbitrarily chosen pairs of start and goal locations.
We then ran A* twice: once on the original maps and again on our modified maps making for
a total of 86400 (432$\times$100$\times$2) distinct experiments.
Our test machine had a 2.93GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, 4GB RAM and
ran OSX 10.6.2.
We use the A* implementation provided in HOG.
