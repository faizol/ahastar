\section{Results}
\label{sec-results}
Table \ref{table-graphsize} reports on the effectiveness of our
symmetry breaking algorithm by measuring the percentage of nodes
pruned from each set of maps.  We give figures for the minimum,
maximum and average number of nodes pruned in each of the three
benchmarks.  We also give the standard deviation as an indicator
for the level of variability associated with each result.  Meanwhile,
in Figure \ref{fig-speedup} we present the average speedup experienced
by A\* when running on our modified grid maps as compared to the
original.  We measure speedup in terms of node expansions and search
times.  For example, a search time speedup of 2.0 is twice as fast and
a node expansion speedup of 2.0 indicates 50\% fewer nodes were
We will discuss our results on each benchmark in turn.

\textbf{Adaptive Depth:} 
The topography of the maps in this benchmark were favourable for
our symmetry breaking technique.  Our decomposition algorithm was
able to identify many large open areas and pruned between 58\%
to 67\% of all nodes.  Its average performance was just over
63\%.  We also observed up to a factor of 3.4 reduction in the average 
number of nodes expanded by A\* and a similar search time speedup.
It is interesting to note that for short instances, for example
those with path lengths $<$ 15, we observed search times that were only 1.7
times faster on average than running A\* on the original map.  
By comparison, instances with
longer path lengths were solved 2.6 to 3.5 times faster.  
This is because in many cases, though not in general, longer paths 
tended to traverse through more empty rooms where there exists more 
opportunities to take advantage of the pruning enhancement.

%Of course this observation assumes the decomposition algorithm is able identify
%symmetric paths in all rooms that appear on the way to the goal.
%Though this is often the case there is no guarantee in general and the performance
%gain experienced by the search algorithm is closely tied to the topography of 
%the map.

\textbf{Baldur's Gate: }
The maps in this benchmark are a mixture of large open areas,
sometimes interspersed with large obstacles, and small to medium
rooms connected by long and narrow corridors.  Performance on this
benchmark is quite different from that observed on Adaptive Depth.
Though our decomposition algorithm prunes as many as 78\% of all
traversable nodes on some maps, its average performance was only
42\%.  There was also a reasonably high level of variability in the
effectiveness of the decomposition from one map to the next, as
indicated by the standard deviation of 11.80\%.  Upon investigation
we found that the 45-degree orientation of the maps in this benchmark
makes it difficult to exactly decompose the traversable areas into
 rectangular rooms.
Nevertheless, we observed that on average search times were improved by a factor
of between 1.8 to 2.3. 
Similar savings were also observed when measuring the average number of nodes
expanded by A\*.
We expect that these results could be
further improved given a more effective decomposition algorithm.
\par 
\textbf{Rooms:} 
The maps in this benchmark were all very similar, comprising of
32$\times$32 rectangular rooms connected by randomly placed entrances.
Each room is of size 7$\times$7 and contains 49 nodes.  24 of these
(or just under 50\%) are interior nodes which we expected would be
pruned.  This was indeed the case: 49.7\% of all nodes were pruned
on average with a standard deviation of just 0.2\%.  
When we ran A\* on these grid maps we observed a factor of 2 reduction 
in the average number of nodes expanded and a corresponding search time
speedup of just under 2.1.
Given rooms with proportionally larger dimensions
we would expect to see a proportionally larger improvement in the
performance of A\*.  We expect the same is also true as rooms become
smaller where in the worst case there are no interior nodes to prune
from any room.
