\section{Conclusion}
We presented a new optimality preserving algorithm for computing shortest paths
on 4-connected grid maps.
We use a hierarchical planning approach that decomposes a map into empty rectangular clusters.
We prove that it is possible to optimally navigate across such clusters by only ever
expanding nodes on their perimeter and never expanding any from the interior.
We undertake an empirical analysis and show that this approach is between 1.7-2.1$\times$ faster than
standard A* on a set of well known games maps. 
At the same time our algorithm is shown to be very memory efficient, 
expanding between 40-70\% fewer nodes than A* on the same set of benchmarks.
Finally, our method is orthogonal to existing techniques meaning it could be easily integrated
as part of a larger framework involving specialised heuristics or other speedup techniques; for example as described in \cite{bjornsoon05,bjornsson06}. 
\par
The obvious direction for further work is extending the algorithm to optimally solving 
shortest path problems in more popular 8-connected grid maps. 
Although the current approach would not translate directly to that domain we believe similar
techniques involving the identification of dominated edges could be highly promising.
Another direction for future work is to develop clustering algorithms that identify maximally
sized empty areas on a given grid map.
We believe this would significantly improve the performance of the current method
