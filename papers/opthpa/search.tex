\section{Optimal Hierarchical Pathfinding}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item{Overview of the method}
  \item{Diagram with proposed method}
  \item{Proof of optimality; needs to discuss dominance. maybe an example?}
  \item{Mechanical details; clustering algorithm w/ diagram from HAA paper.
    naive methods work too but want to optimise for larger clusters}.
  \item{how to frame each cluster; how to generate successors}.
  \item{description of expansion algorithm? or clustering alg?}
  \item{Insertion of start node. Don't need to insert goal node. }
\end{enumerate}
