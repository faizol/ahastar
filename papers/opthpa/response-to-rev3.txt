Thank you for the feedback.

HPA* and PRA* were both tested on BaldursGate (BGM). In both cases authors report a ~10x speedup over A*; OHA* speedup is ~2x on BGM. HPA*/PRA* produce near-optimal paths but no guarantees are reported; OHA* is always optimal. As in other search problems (eg, planning), ensuring optimality is harder.

We compared with A* because OHA* is a direct substitute (on 4connected gridmaps). As A* is core in HPA*, OHA* could be used to speedup HPA* steps (start/target insertion and path refinement).

Wrt applicability to other grid maps: it seems possible to extend OHA* to 8connected maps (future work). When perimeter crawling makes current path prefix suboptimal (8connected-wise), connect the last node on the path prefix to the parent of the parent through a 8connected optimal shortcut edge.

We agree with your suggestion to change the name of the algorithm.
