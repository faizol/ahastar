HPA* and PRA* were both tested on BaldursGate (BGM). In both cases authors report a ~10x speedup over A*; OHA* speedup
is ~2x on BGM. HPA*/PRA* produce near-optimal paths but no guarantees are reported; OHA* is always optimal.
We felt a comparison with A* would be more relevant as OHA* is a direct substitute (on 4connected gridmaps). HPA* and PRA*, being suboptimal, are not. Further, OHA* could be used to speedup HPA* steps (start/target insertion and path refinement).


We do not believe OHA*, as is, would preserve optimality on 8connected gridmaps.
Your suggestion to study this more general domain is interesting as future work.

While our work is inspired by HPA* (a fact we wanted to reflect in its name) it does perhaps share more in common with macro operator techniques. We would be happy to change its name to reflect this.
