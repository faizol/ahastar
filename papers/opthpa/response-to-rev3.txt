We do not believe OHA*, as is, would preserve optimality on 8-connected grid maps.
Your suggestion to study this more general domain is interesting as future work.

Your observation that OHA* is a misnomer is a good point. While our work is inspired by
HPA* (a fact we wanted to reflect in its name) it does perhaps share more
in common with macro operator techniques. We would be happy to change its name to reflect this.

HPA* and PRA* were both tested on BGM with best reported speedup ~10; OHA* is ~2 on BGM. HPA* paths are
near optimal but simple examples exist with arbitrarily suboptimal paths; OHA* is always optimal.
We felt a comparison with A* would be more relevant as OHA* is a direct substitute (on 4-connected grid maps).
HPA* and PRA*, being suboptimal, are not.
Further, as OHA* is an A* substitute, OHA* could be used to speedup HPA* steps (start/target insertion and path refinement).
