Thank you for your review.

There is a speed-optimality tradeoff in OHA* vs HPA*/PRA*. HPA* and PRA* were both tested on BaldursGate (BGM). In both
cases authors report a ~10x speedup over A*; OHA* speedup is ~2x on BGM. HPA*/PRA* produce near-optimal paths but no
guarantees are reported; OHA* is always optimal. As in other search problems (eg, AI planning), ensuring optimality is
harder.

Why we compared to A*: A* is core in many pathfinding techniques. As both are optimal (unlike HPA*/PRA*), OHA* is a
direct substitute for A* on 4connected grids. For example, replacing A* with OHA* could speed up HPA* steps, such as
start/target insertion and path refinement.

Wrt applicability to other gridmaps: we believe it should be possible to extend OHA* to 8connected grids (future work).
However, as you remark, 4connected grids are important on their own.

We agree with your suggestion to rename the algorithm.
