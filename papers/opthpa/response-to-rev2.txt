Thank you for the feedback.

OHA* doesn't strictly require a decomposition into empty rectangles. When a rectangle is available, OHA* explores that area fast. Otherwise, OHA* performs standard A* search. Results on maps like Figure4 are reported in Figure5 (BG=BaldursGate).

We argued in resposeToReview1 where 4connected maps are useful.

Preprocessing the map is done offline and not included in reported search times. As the decomposition is reused many times, these costs are amortized. Existing pathfinding techniques (memory heuristics, hierarchical abstraction) make similar distinctions between preprocessing and online search.

We agree that each of Voronoi, visibility, and grid graphs has pros and cons. Eg, visibility graphs can exhibit a large branching factor. We study grid maps as they are widely used.

Regarding "unnatural look": A path fragment bent along the perimeter of an empty rectangle can be replaced without additional search with a lengthwise equivalent fragment that steps inside the rectangle.
