Table1 summarizes the efficiency of our greedy decomposition. Your suggestion for a constant-bound suboptimal decomposition is interesting for future work.

Re map orientation: This is indeed the main reason for lower performance on Baldur's Gate maps (BGM). 
On BGM our decomposition often identifies long narrow rectangles with few interior nodes. This leads to a smaller
speedup.

OHA* has no significant overhead per node. It even reduces the branching factor sometimes by 1. Figure5 shows that time speedup gets larger than node speedup because OHA* maintains a smaller open list.

We discuss in responseToReview3 how OHA* compares with HPA* and PRA*.

Commonality of 4connected grids: As Reviewer3 remarks, they are "very common in video games and many test domains". Eg,
games appearing on low-memory, low-speed mobile devices such as My Little Tank (iPhone), Heroes of Mana (Nintendo DS), Legacy of Goku
(Gameboy Advance)
