\section{Theoretical Overview}
Overview of our approach.
Notice that in most games related applications large sections
of the map are divided into rooms or other areas. 
Most of the space is empty; we want to avoid expanding all nodes in 
a room unnecessarily.
Give an A* example of CSC2F. 

We propose traversing only along the perimeter of these rooms
When the gridmap is only connected in 4 directions such traversals
are optimal because although many paths exist they are all dominated
by a very small number of paths.

Example of our method on CSC2F. 

This approach is optimal because... now give a nice proof.

\subsection{Octile grid maps}.
Explain why this approach doesn't work for 8-connected grids.
