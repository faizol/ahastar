Hierarchical pathfinding algorithms such as HPA* work by decomposing a large map into a much smaller approximation that can be efficiently searched. This approach is fast, complete and memory efficient but usually suboptimal. In this paper we develop a new hierarchical algorithm which is guaranteed to return optimal solutions on 4-connected grid maps. Our approach identifies obstacle-free areas which can be optimally traversed by only expanding nodes along their perimeter. We give an empirical analysis and demonstrate that this method is fast, memory efficient, and produces optimal paths.
