\begin{abstract}
Hierarchical pathfinding algorithms such as HPA* work by decomposing a 
large map into a much smaller approximation that can be efficiently 
searched.
This approach is fast, complete and memory efficient but usually suboptimal.
In this paper we develop a new variant of HPA* which is guaranteed to return
optimal solutions on 4-connected gridmap domains.
Our approach relies on a new abstraction technique that identifies obstacle-free areas 
(or clusters) which can be optimally traversed by only expanding nodes along their perimeter.
We give an empirical analysis and demonstrate that this method has similar running-time 
characteristics to HPA*.
