techniques\section{Results}
First we compare and contrast the performance of our jump points
pruning algorithm with the Swamps method of
\citeauthor{pochter10}~\shortcite{pochter10}. 
Both Swamps and jump points belong to the same family of methods:
optimality preserving pruning techniques for speeding up pathfinding.
When evaluating Swamps we used the authors'
source code and ran all experiments using their recommended running parameters:
a swamp seed radius of 6 and ``no change limit'' of 2. 
\par
Next, we compare and contrast the performance of jump points pruning 
against the HPA* algorithm of \citeauthor{botea04}~\shortcite{botea04}.
Though sub-optimal, HPA* is very fast and therefore widely applied in video
games. We compare against it to establish whether or not jump points are 
equally applicable in similar contexts. 
When evaluating HPA* we used a custom implementation of the algorithm and a
fixed cluster size of 10 (as recommended by the original authors).
\par
We discuss performance in terms of search times and compare 
the average speedup experienced by A* when running with and
without pruning methods applied to the map.  Using this metric a speedup of
2.0 is twice as fast (higher is better).
