\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:relatedwork}
The academic literature is rich in works that deal with the problem of symmetry
in search.  Approaches for identifying and eliminating symmetry have been
proposed in areas as as diverse as planning \cite{fox99}, constraint programming
\cite{gent00}, and combinatorial optimization \cite{fukunaga08}. Until recently
however, very few works explicitly identify and deal with symmetry in pathfinding
domains such as grid maps.
%This is not surprising given that, in the
%presence of symmetry, search algorithms often evaluate many equivalent states
%and make little real progress toward the goal.  Despite receiving significant
%attention in other areas, there are very few works that explicitly identify and
%deal with symmetry in pathfinding domains such as grid maps.

One recent study which attempts to redress this oversight 
Empty Rectangular Rooms~\cite{harabor10}: a symmetry breaking technique specific to 4-connected uniform-cost grid maps.
This offline algorithm decomposes the search space into a series of obstacle-free rectangles.
Nodes from the interior of each rectangle are then pruned and
replaced by a series of macro edges that facilitate optimal travel from any node
on the perimeter of a rectangle to any other.  Being specific to 4-connected
maps this approach is less general than our jump point technique. It also
requires offline pre-processing whereas our method is online.
\par
Related to our work are two similar search space reduction techniques: the
\emph{dead-end heuristic} \cite{bjornsson06} and \emph{Swamps} \cite{pochter10}.
Both methods use an offline pre-processing step to decompose a grid into a
series of adjacent areas.  Later, a preliminary online search in the decomposed
graph identifies areas that do not have to be explored in order to optimally
reach the goal.  This objective is similar yet orthogonal our work where
the aim is to reduce the effort required to explore any given area in the search
space.
\par
A different method for pruning the state-space is to identify \emph{dead} and 
\emph{redundant} cells~\cite{sturtevant10}.
Developed in the context of learning-based heuristic search, these approaches 
are used to speed up pathfinding in real-time settings.
Unlike jump points, a speedup is only obtained after running multiple 
iterations of the plan-learn-execute cycle. Further, the identification of
redundant cells requires additional memory overheads which jump points do not have. 
\par
A recent suggestion for speeding up optimal A* search is to \emph{fast expand}
nodes~\cite{sun09}.  This approach avoids unnecessary open list operations by
identifying and immediately expanding successor nodes which are just as good or
better than the node currently at the top of the open list.  Jump points are a
similar yet fundamentally different idea: they allow us to identify large sets
of nodes that would be ordinarily expanded but which can be skipped entirely.
\par
In cases where optimality is not required, hierarchical pathfinding methods are pervasive.
The main idea is to improve performance by decomposing the 
search space (usually a grid map) into a much smaller approximation.  Algorithms
of this type, such as HPA*~\cite{botea04}, are  usually fast and memory-efficient 
but also suboptimal.
