\section{Optimality}
Sketch: show that each pruning rule discards only neighbours
which cannot belong to the optimal path for the problem at hand.
Then, by induction, demonstrate that jump points have the same 
property. 

Complications:
 - jump points when passing the row or column associated with the goal
 - no jump points at the top of a row/column ending in an obstacle.
