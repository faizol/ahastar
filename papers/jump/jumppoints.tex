\section{Jump Points}
In the previous section we developed simple rules for pruning neighbours during 
individual node expansions. We now extend this idea in order to define a 
macro-step operator which speeds up optimal search by selectively expanding
only certain nodes on a grid map which we term \emph{jump points}.

\begin{definition}
\label{def:jump}
A node $x$ is designated a jump point if it satisfies at least one of the following
conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item{$x$ is a node which, after pruning, is adjacent to at least one neighbour
whose evaluation is forced according to the rules in Section
\ref{sec:prunestraight} and Section \ref{sec:prunediagonal}.}
\item{$x$ has one or more neighbours which are themselves jump points.}
\item{$x$ is located on the same row or column of the grid as the goal.}
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}


\subsection{Search}

The general process for searching with jump points can be outlined as 
such: following a pruning operation on some arbitrary node $x$, we defer the immediate 
generation of each remaining neighbour $n$ and, instead, continue travelling in the same direction as from $x$
to $n$.
Thus, we travel past $n$ and instead consider a node $m$ which is two steps
removed from $x$.
At each step, we apply the appropriate pruning rules (straight or
diagonal) and continue this process until we reach an obstacle or identify an 
eventual successor which satisfies certain properties and which we term a 
\emph{jump point}.
If we find such a jump point, we generate it as a successor of $x$; if we do not 
find a jump point, we generate nothing.


\noindent
Figure \ref{fig:pruningrules}(b) shows an example of jump point which satisfies the
first condition of Defintion \ref{def:jump}: here we cannot apply Straight Pruning
Rule 4 as the evaluation of neighbour 3 is forced.
The same is true of the example in Figure \ref{fig:pruningrules}(d): we cannot
apply Diagonal Pruning Rule 3 as the evaluation of neighbour 1 is forced.

After pruning, any neighbour which is forced is immediately generated.
We try to defer the generation of the other neighbours by seeing if we can 
jump to a location further away in the same direction.

\subsection{Optimality}
Sketch: show that each pruning rule discards only neighbours
which cannot belong to the optimal path for the problem at hand.
Then, by induction, demonstrate that jump points have the same 
property. 

Complications:
 - jump points when passing the row or column associated with the goal
 - no jump points at the top of a row/column ending in an obstacle.
