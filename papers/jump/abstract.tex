Pathfinding in a grid-based environment is a problem which commonly arises in
many real-world application areas; for example robotics and video games.  The
state-of-the-art in this area is dominated by hierarchical pathfinding
algorithms which are fast and have small memory overheads but usually return
suboptimal paths.  
In this paper we present a novel search strategy, specific to
grids, which is fast, optimal and requires no memory overhead.  Our approach can
be described as a search-tree pruning technique in which we reduce the branching
factor associated with a given node by proving that some of its neighbours do
not need to be considered.  Through repeated application of our simple pruning
rules we can speed up a standard search algorithm such as A* by an order of
magnitude and more.  We obtain these results on various synthetic and real-world
benchmarks taken from the literature, including two from the popular video games
\emph{Dragon Age: Origins} and \emph{Baldur's Gate II}.
