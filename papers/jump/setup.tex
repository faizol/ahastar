\section{Experimental Setup}
We evaluate the performance of RSR on four benchmarks taken from the freely
available pathfinding library Hierarchical Open Graph
(HOG)\footnote{\url{http://www.googlecode.com/p/hog2}}: {\textbf{Adaptive Depth}
is a set of 12 maps of size 100$\times$100 in which approximately $\frac{1}{3}$
of each map is divided into rectangular rooms of varying size and a large
open area interspersed with large randomly placed obstacles.} {\textbf{Baldur's
Gate} and \textbf{Dragon Age} are map sets taken from BioWare's popular
roleplaying games \emph{Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn} and \emph{Dragon Age:
Origns}.  Baldur's Gate often appears as a standard
benchmark in the literature \cite{bjornsson06,harabor10,pochter10}. 
There are 120 maps in total which have all been scaled to size $512\times512$.
Dragon Age is a comparatively newer benchmark but has appeaed previously in the
literature; e.g. \cite{sturtevant07}. It consists of 156 maps which range in size
from $30\times21$ to $1104\times1260$.}
{\textbf{Rooms} is a set of 300 maps of size
256$\times$256 which are divided into symmetric rows of small rectangular areas
($7\times7$), connected by randomly placed entrances. This benchmark has
previously appeared in \cite{pochter10}.}

Our test machine had a 2.93GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, 4GB RAM and ran OSX 
10.6.4.  Our implementation of A* is based on one provided in HOG, which we 
adapted to facilitate online neighbour pruning and jump point identification.
