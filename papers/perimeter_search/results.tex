\section{Results}
\label{sec-results}
Our main results are given in Table \ref{table-graphsize}, Table
\ref{table-speedup} and Figure \ref{fig-speedup}.
We will briefly introduce each and then discuss them in the context
of our three benchmarks.
\par
Table \ref{table-graphsize} measures the size of our modified grid maps.
We give figures for the average number of nodes and average number of edges
as a proportion of the number of nodes and edges in the original grid maps
from each benchmark.
