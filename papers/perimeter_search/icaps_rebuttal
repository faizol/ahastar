We thank all the reviewers for their time and valuable comments.
We will respond to each in turn.

1. Scholarship: We agree that such references, although not directly relevant 
to our problem, would better contextualise the paper. We would be happy to 
comment on and contrast these works to ours.

2. Symmetry: We define two paths to be symmetric if they:
  (a) Have the same start and end point; and
  (b) One can be obtained from the other by reordering the moves.
      E.g., north, north, northeast --> north, northeast, north.

Detailed comments: A tile is an atomic node on a grid map.
Rooms are obstacle-free rectangles discovered by our method.
The Octile Heuristic is the cost of a shortest path on 8-connected grid maps
under the optimistic assumption that there are no obstacles between the two points at hand.

Review 2:

Are there enough macro edges in a fan to preserve optimality? Provably yes.

Are they too many? We are unaware of any other method for further reducing 
the fan size. We made a number of such attempts but in each case found counter-examples where 
optimality was not preserved.

A more detailed theoretical analysis of our algorithm, including 
detailed proofs, is available but was omitted due to space constraints. We will make 
these available as part of a later technical report.

More varied benchmarks: The Baldur's Gate benchmark is a de-facto standard in modern 
pathfinding works. We also include comparisons on benchmarks taken from a HOG, a popular 
pathfinding library which appears regularly in the literature.

Review 3:
**********

Narrow applicability: We believe this comment is a misunderstanding.
Our algorithm is applicable to ANY grid map, as empty rooms are discovered 
automatically. If the topography of the grid is unfriendly for our decomposition 
algorithm, we simply build smaller rooms and the speed-up achieved is more modest.

Pre-processing times: It is common in the pathfinding literature to have an 
offline and online phase. We excluded times for the offline phase due to space 
constraints but agree it is useful data. 
In our experience, preprocessing for even the largest maps (960*960) takes only a 
small number of seconds. This cost is amortised over each of the many subsequent 
searches. 

Comparison with MSA*: We compared our performance with this algorithm but as
it's speedup over A* is so small (never more than 2x and often less), we did not 
include these results in the paper.

Path length: The maps for Figure 5D are of size 100x100; there simply do not exist 
many problems we could generate with solution length much larger than 150. 
We did increase the size of these maps by a factor of 3 however and ran a similar set 
of experiements; these results are available in Figure 5G.
