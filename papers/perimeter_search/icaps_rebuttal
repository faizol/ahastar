We thank all the reviewers for their time and valuable comments.
We will respond to each in turn.

Review1:

1. Scholarship: We agree that such references, although not directly relevant 
to our problem, would better contextualise the paper. We would be happy to 
comment on and contrast these works to ours.

2. Symmetry: We define two paths to be symmetric if they:
  (a) Have the same start and end point; and
  (b) One can be obtained from the other by reordering the moves.
      E.g., north, north, northeast --> north, northeast, north.

Detailed comments: A tile is an atomic node on a grid map.
Rooms are obstacle-free rectangles discovered by our method.
The Octile Heuristic is the cost of a shortest path on 8-connected grid maps
under the optimistic assumption that there are no obstacles between the two points at hand.

Review2:

Decomposition: We use the decomposition method from [Harabor and Botea, 2010].
It greedily constructs the largest possible empty rectangle from 
tiles not assigned yet to a rectangle.
We find that larger rooms yield better performance. 

Are there enough macro edges in a fan to preserve optimality? Provably yes.

Are they too many? We are unaware of any other method for further reducing 
the fan size. We made a number of attempts but always found counter-examples where 
optimality was not preserved.

A more detailed theoretical analysis of our algorithm, including optimality
proofs for perimeter reduction,
is available but was omitted due to space constraints. We will make 
these available as part of a later technical report.

More varied benchmarks: There are very few standard problem sets, involving
grids, which appear regularly in the literature. 
Baldur's Gate is a de-facto standard appearing in many papers. We also used 2 
other benchmarks taken from HOG, a popular pathfinding library.

Review3:
**********

Narrow applicability: We believe this comment is a misunderstanding.
Our algorithm is applicable to ANY grid map, as empty rooms are discovered 
automatically. If the topography of the grid is unfriendly for our decomposition 
algorithm, we simply build smaller rooms and the speed-up achieved is more modest.

Pre-processing times: 
In our experience, the largest non-scaled map (320x320) takes less than a second
to pre-process. Scaled maps take significantly longer, but never more than 30
seconds. This cost is amortised over each of the many subsequent searches. 
This is much faster than Swamps, which takes BLAH and BLAH respectively
on the largest map (original and scaled).

Comparison with MSA*: We compared RSR with this algorithm but as its speedup 
over A* is so small (20% or less in most cases on Baldur's Gate), we did not include these 
results in our paper. 

Path length: The maps for Figure 5D are of size 100x100; there simply do not exist 
many problems we could generate with solution length much larger than 150. 
We did increase the size of these maps by a factor of 3 however and ran a similar set 
of experiements; these results are available in Figure 5G.
