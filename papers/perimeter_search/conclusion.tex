\section{Conclusion}
Perimeter Search is a symmetric path elimination technique which extends the the
work of \citeauthor{harabor10}~\shortcite{harabor10} from 4-connected grid maps
to the much more common 8-connected case.
We speed up optimal pathfinding by applying an offline decompostion algorithm to
divide a grid map into a series of empty rectangular rooms.
We then show that it is possible to traverse optimally from one side of a room
to another without exploring any tiles from the interior of any room.
Our experiments show that in the presence of large rooms or wide open areas we can 
compute optimal paths very quickly: up to 16 times faster, on average for 4-connected maps and up to
6.5 times faster, on average, for 8-connected maps.
On less favourable map topographies we achieve more modest improvements.
Our method is simple to understand, very effective and can be combined with
existing speedup techniques such as memory heuristics or hierarchical methods;
for example as described in \cite{botea04,bjornsson05,bjornsson06}.

%One direction for future work is to investigate alternative decomposition
%algorithms which produce bigger rooms and improve the performance of the current
%method.
