\section{Conclusion}
We presented a novel technique for symmetric path elimination in 4 and 8-connected grid maps.
Our method extends the work in \cite{harabor10} from 4-connected grid maps to the much more common
8-connected case.
In the process we also develop two novel methods for reducing branching factor and significantly
improve the performance search on a wide range of realistic game maps -- including one well known 
set from the game \emph{Baldur's Gate II}. 
\par
The performance of our method depends on the topography of individual maps: 
in the presence of large rooms or wide open areas we can often compute optimal paths much faster 
than searching on the original map. 
On less favourable map topographies we achieve more modest improvements.
However, since our method is orthogonal to existing search techniques, it could be integrated
as part of a larger framework involving specialised heuristics or other speedup techniques; 
for example as described in \cite{botea04,bjornsson05,bjornsson06}. 
\par
One direction for future work is to investigate alternative decomposition
algorithms which produce bigger rooms and improve the performance of the current
method.
