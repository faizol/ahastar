\section{Breaking Symmetries on 8-connected Grid Maps}
Symmetric search spaces appear in many areas of Artificial Intelligence (for example, constraint programming \cite{walsh07})
and in almost all cases they are undesirable. 
This is because symmetry forces search algorithms to waste time by evaluating
large numbers of identical states without making any real progress towards the goal.
A recent method for breaking path symmetries in 4-connected grid maps is described in \cite{harabor10}.
It relies on an Empty Rooms decomposition which we will briefly present here due to its central importance to the
remainder of this paper.
\par
Explain how we extend this to 8-connected grids.
We will discuss the changes necessary to the offline
pruning step as well as the online re-insertion procedure.

We might also need a short description of how rooms are identified to begin with.
