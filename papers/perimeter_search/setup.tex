\section{Experimental Setup}
To evaluate the effectiveness of our ideas we performed
an analysis on a number of benchmarks taken from
the freely available pathfinding library 
Hierarchical Open Graph (HOG)\footnote{\url{http://www.googlecode.com/p/hog2}}:
\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Adaptive Depth} is a set of 12 maps of size 100$\times$100 in which approximately
$\frac{1}{3}$ of each map is divided into adjacent rectangular rooms of
varying size and the rest of the map is a large open area interspersed with 
large randomly placed obstacles.}
\item{\textbf{Baldur's Gate} is a set of 120 maps taken from BioWare's popular
roleplaying game \emph{Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn}. 
Often appearing as a standard benchmark in the literature 
\cite{botea04,bjornsson05,bjornsson06,sturtevant07} these maps range in 
size from 50$\times$50 to 320$\times$320 and have a distinctive 45-degree orientation.}
\item{\textbf{Rooms} is a set of 300 maps of size 256$\times$256 which are divided into 32$\times$32
rectangular areas that are connected by randomly placed entrances.}
\end{itemize}

As discussed later, we also used a blown up version of these maps,
where each tile on the original map is replaced with $3\times3$ tiles of the same type
(i.e., blocked or traversable). In effect, our input data contains 864 maps in total,
with sizes up to $960\times960$.

Since our work is applicable to both 4 and 8 connected grid maps we used two
copies each map: one in which diagonal transitions are allowed and another
in which they are not.
For each map we generated 100 valid problem instances, checking that every
instance could be solved both with and without the use of diagonal
transitions.
%The text below ignores a few things: 
%1. Swamps
%2. blown up maps
%
%We then ran A* twice: once on the original (4 and 8 connected) maps and again 
%on our modified (4 and 8 connected) maps. 
%This makes for a total of 172800 (432$\times$2$\times$100$\times$2) distinct experiments.
Our test machine had a 2.93GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, 4GB RAM and
ran OSX 10.6.2.
We use the A* implementation provided in HOG.
