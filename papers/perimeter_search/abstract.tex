Pathfinding is a widely studied problem in the AI literature with broad 
applicability in areas such as planning, robotics and video games. 
In this paper, we explore a symmetry-based search space reduction technique
 which can speed up optimal pathfinding by up to 38 times on 
a range of uniform cost grid maps taken from the literature.
Additionally, we report up to a factor of five decrease in average search 
times when we compare our work with two recent state-of-the-art
search space reduction algorithms.
Our technique makes use of a two stage offline pre-processing method:
First, we decompose an arbitrary grid map into a set of empty rectangular 
rooms, removing from each such room all interior tiles and possibly 
some from along the perimeter. 
Second, we add a series of edges between selected pairs of remaining 
perimeter tiles to facilitate provably optimal traversal through each room.
We also introduce a novel online pruning technique to further speed up search.
Our algorithm does not require any significant extra memory and retains the 
same optimality and completeness guarantees as searching on an unmodified graph.
