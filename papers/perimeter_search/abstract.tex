Pathfinding is a widely studied problem in the AI literature with broad
applicability in areas such as planning, robotics and video games.
In this paper we introduce a novel symmetry-based search space reduction
technique which speeds up optimal pathfinding on uniform cost grid maps that
have cardinality 4 or 8.
Our method involves decomposing a grid map into a set of empty rectangular rooms
and removing from each such room all interior tiles, leaving only a boundary 
perimeter.
We then add a series of macro edges between pairs of tiles on the perimeter to 
facilitate provably optimal traversal through each room and to any other room.
We evaluate our technique on a range of different grid maps, including one well
known set from the popular video game Baldur's Gate II.
We show that standard search algorithm such as A*, running on our modified 
graphs, can be up to an order of magnitude faster than otherwise. 
We achieve this result without requiring any significant extra memory and 
retain the same optimality guantees as searching on an original, umodified,
search graph.
