Pathfinding is a widely studied problem with broad 
applicability in areas such as planning, robotics and video games.  In this
paper, we explore a symmetry-based search space reduction technique
 which can speed up optimal pathfinding by up to 38 times on
a range of uniform cost grid maps taken from the literature.  Additionally, we
report up to a 3.5 times improvement in average search times when we compare
our work with two recent state-of-the-art search space reduction algorithms.
Our technique uses a 2-step offline preprocessing method: First we
decompose an arbitrary grid map into a set of empty rectangles,
removing from each rectangle all interior nodes and possibly some from
along the perimeter.  Second, we add a series of edges between selected pairs of
remaining perimeter nodes to facilitate provably optimal traversal through each
rectangle.  We also develop a novel online pruning technique to further speed
up search.  Our algorithm does not require any significant extra memory and
retains the same optimality and completeness guarantees as searching on an
unmodified graph.
