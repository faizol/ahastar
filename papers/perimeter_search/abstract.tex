In this paper we introduce Perimeter Search: a new symmetry breaking 
pathfinding technique specific to 4-connected and 8-connected grid maps.
Our method involves decomposing a grid map into a set of empty rectangular rooms
and removing from each such room all interior tiles, leaving only a boundary perimeter.
We then add a series of macro edges between pairs of tiles on the perimeter to facilitate
provably optimal traversal through each room and to any other room.
We evaluate our technique on a range of different grid maps, including one well known set from
the popular video game Baldur's Gate II.
We show that A*, running on our modified grid maps, can be up to an order of magnitude faster
than otherwise. 
We achieve this result without requiring any significant extra memory and retain the same 
optimality guantees as searching on an original, umodified, grid map.
