\section{Reducing The Branching Factor}
Consider an empty room of width $w$ and height $h$ where $w > h$.  After adding
all non-dominated macro edges, each tile from the perimeter will have between $h$ to $2h-1$
neighbours from the opposite side of the room, up to 2 neighbours from the same
side of the room and up to 5 other neighbours from adjacent rooms.  Such a high
branching factor is undesirable as individual node expansion operations take
longer.

In this section we
study two branching factor reduction methods.  The first is an offline technique
that prunes tiles from the perimeter of each room.  The second is an online
pruning strategy which we apply during individual node expansion operations.  We
discuss both methods in the context of 8-connected grid maps however they are
equally applicable to 4-connected maps.

\noindent
\textbf{Perimeter Reduction:}
We observe that in many cases there are tiles on the perimeter of an empty room which have no neighbours from any 
adjacent room. 
These tiles represent intermediate locations between entry and exit points that lead into and out of each empty room.
To speed up search we propose pruning from the perimeter of each room all such nodes.
To preserve optimality, we will connect the neighbours of each pruned node directly to each other.
The weight of each new edge is therefore equal to the octile distance between the two neighbours.
Figure \ref{fig-branching} (Top) shows an example.
As we will see this optimisation can have a dramatic effect on the average performance of
A* on certain types of maps.

\begin{lemma}
Perimeter reduction preserves path optimality.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Sketch:
Each time we prune a node from the perimeter we add a new edge between all its
neighbours with weight equal to the heuristic distance between each pair of 
neighbours.
Thus, if a path exists between a pair of tiles before the application of
perimeter reduction it is guaranteed to exist afterward.
Further, the length of this path is unchanged.
\end{proof}

\textbf{Online Node Pruning:} 
When expanding an arbitrary node from the perimeter of a room we observe that
it is not necessary to consider any secondary neighbours if both the node
and its predecessor belong to the same room. Figure \ref{fig-branching} (Bottom) shows an 
example of such a situation; any path to a secondary neighbour is strictly
dominated by an alternative path through the predecessor.
We apply this observation as follows:
1) {Divide the neighbours associated with each tile on the perimeter of an empty room into two distinct sets:
\emph{primary neighbours} and \emph{secondary neighbours}.
Secondary neighbours are those which are located on the opposite side of the
room to the current tile  (excluding any corner tiles).
Primary neighbours are all the rest.}
2) {During node expansion, determine which room the parent of the current node belongs to.}
3) {If the current node has no parent or it belongs to a different room than
its parent process all primary and secondary neighbours. Otherwise, process only primary neighbours.}

\begin{lemma}
Online node pruning preserves path optimality.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Sketch:
Let $m$ be a node on the perimeter of a room. Assume that its parent $p$ belongs
to the same room.
Let $n$ be a secondary successor of $m$.
Recall that $n$ and $m$ are on opposite sides of the room.
We argue below that passing through $m$ cannot possibly improve the 
best path between $p$ and $n$.
Therefore, there is no need to consider $(m,n)$ macro-edges
when $m$ and $p$ belong to the same room.

There are 4 cases when a node $m$ and its parent $p$ belong to the
same room. In case 1, $p$ is a re-inserted tile from the interior of the room. 
Obviously, the path segment $p,m,n$ is suboptimal, as we zigzag from $p$ to $m$
on one side of the room and then to $n$ on the opposite
side of the room.
In cases 2, 3, and 4, $p$ and $m$ are on opposite sides, on orthogonal sides or 
on the same side of the room. As in case 1, it is possible to check in each case that
taking a detour through $m$ does not improve the shortest path from $p$ to $n$.
\end{proof}

%Let $R$ be an empty room in an 8-connected grid map.
%Further, let $m$ and $n$ be two arbitrarily selected tiles from the perimeter of $R$.
%There are three cases to consider when searching for an optimal path between $m$ and $n$:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item{$m$ and $n$ are on the same side of the room.}
%\item{$m$ and $n$ are on orthogonal sides of the room.}
%\item{$m$ and $n$ are on opposite sides of the room.}
%\end{enumerate}
%In all cases we begin by expanding $m$ and process all its primary and secondary neighbours.
%In the first and second case the optimal path from $m$ to $n$ involves no tiles from the opposite side of the room;
%the decision to ignore all secondary neighbours has no effect on the optimality of the solution.
%In the third case we argue as follows:
%when we expand $m$ we generate a node $n'$ on the same side of the perimeter as $n$.
%The edge $(m, n')$ represents a path that crosses the room from $m$ to $n'$
%using a maximum number of diagonal steps. 
%From this it is trivial to derive that the path $\lbrace m, n', n \rbrace$ is itself optimal.
%Thus we can ignore all secondary neighbours of nodes descended from $m$ in the search tree
%(evaluating them could not possibly improve the length of any path from $m$ to $n$).
%\end{proof}
%%It is worth noting that on 4-connected maps the branching factor of each tile on
%%the perimeter is already constant. 
%%Applying Fast Node Expansion in this case often results in an average branching
%%factor smaller than 4. 
%%On 8-connected maps the effectiveness of this approach is dependent on how well
%%we can decomposde the grid map into large rectangular rooms.
