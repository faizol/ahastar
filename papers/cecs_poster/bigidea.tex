We propose the following offline strategy for identifying and \textbf{eliminating
symmetric paths} in 4-connected grid maps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Decompose the grid map into a set of empty rectangular rooms.}
\item{Prune all tiles not on the perimeter of an empty room.}
\item{Connect tiles on opposite sides of the perimeter.}
\end{enumerate}
Sometimes a tile which has been pruned is later required; for example as a start
or goal location. 
We handle these cases by temporarily re-inserting the 
required tile back into the grid map for the duration of the search.
