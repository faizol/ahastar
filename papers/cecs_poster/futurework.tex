\section{Future Work}
We are investigating a number of extensions:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Symmetry elimination techniques that allow us to \textbf{avoid dead-end rooms} from which the goal cannot be reached. }
\item{A symmetry elimination algorithm for \textbf{8-connected grid maps}.
Such maps also exhibit a high degree of path symmetry but the problem is more
difficult due to higher branching factor.
}
\item{\textbf{Hybrid algorithms} that combine our speedup technique with existing methods
to achieve further performance increases.}
\end{itemize}
