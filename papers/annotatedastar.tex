\section{Annotated A*}
\label{aha:aastar}
Low-level planning for our extended problem using clearance values is a straightforward application of the ideas thus far.
We term the resultant algorithm Annotated A* (AA* for short).
It is a variation on the A* algorithm \cite{astar} to compute an optimal shortest path between a start and goal node.  
Our approach differs from standard A* by requiring two additional parameters for each query: the agent's size and capability. This allows us to map any query into a canonical problem as shown earlier.
Recall that the clearance can be computed on demand for each visited location.
Therefore marking atomic octiles as blocked or traversable in the canonical problem can be performed
dynamically, with no need to precompute and store a map for each combination of an agent size and capability.
% by using the parameters to evaluate nodes before they are added to A*'s open list.
